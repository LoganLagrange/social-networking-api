## Description
        
This project emulates an api system that might be used in a social network of some kind. It implements full CRUD functionality using restful routing to interact with a NoSQL (MongoDB) database from an express server and is demonstrated using insomnia to test the routes. It could easily be attached to a front end set up in a variety of ways for a ready to use database api. It also uses Mongoose to introduce some sense of sturcture to the data.

## Installation
        
The program can be easily installed (assuming you already have MongoDB set up on your machine) by cloning the repo and running the npm install command in the cli root directory. Run node index.js and the server will run.
        
## Usage
        
The api is usable from a program like insomnia to interact with the database, (see attached video) as it does not have a front end set up. All of the routes found in the code can be used and area fully functional. User can be created, updated, and deleted, as well as thoughts and reactions to them. Yhoughts can also be updated and deleted and have reactions added or removed. Run the command node index.js in the cli under the root directory and the server will run and be ready for use.
